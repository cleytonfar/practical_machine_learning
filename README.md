**Practical Machine Learning Project**

Nowadays the use of wearble devices by people has become as usual as the use of 
ordinary clothings. Wearable technology has a variety of applications which grows
as the field itself expands. A proeminent example of such device is the activity trackers in which people use to quantify how much of a particular activity they do. 
One common issue is that the use of activity trackers rarely quantify/identify 
how well people do a certain activity.

Using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbbell of 6 participants
in which they were asked to perform Weight lifting exercises (Unilateral Dumbbell
Biceps Curl), I was able to investigate "how well" an activity was performed by 
the wearer through the analysis of machine learning models. 

Using an approach in which devides the dataset into training and validation to 
test the performance of the resulted algorithm, the model was able to correctly
classify 99.8% of the instances.
